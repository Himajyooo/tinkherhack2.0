# MISSION_ENCRYPT

This project is a simple, user-friendly application developed using Python and Streamlit, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt text messages using various encryption methods  such as caesar cipher, Advanced Encryption Standard(AES) and ConsVow (newly developed algorithm)

## Features
### 1.User-friendly Interface:
 
### 2.Encryption Methods:
 Users can choose from a variety of encryption methods including:
#### (i) AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): 
A symmetric encryption algorithm widely used for securing sensitive data.
#### (ii) Caesar Cipher: 
A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a certain number of places.
#### (iii) ConsVow 

It is a variant of caeser cipher method where both consonents and vowels are separately encrypted / decrypted and combined together to form the required text 
### 3.Encryption and Decryption:
 Users can encrypt and decrypt text messages with the selected encryption method.
### 4. Clear Output: 
The application provides clear outputs for encrypted and decrypted text, making it easy for users to understand the results.

## How to Use
### > Input Text: ###
 Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt in the text input area.
### >  Select Encryption Method:
 Choose the encryption method from the dropdown menu.
### > Encryption & Decryption: 
Click the "Encrypt" and "Decrypt" button to process the text with the selected method.
### > View Results: 
The encrypted or decrypted text will be displayed along with any necessary keys or parameters.
## Technologies Used
### > Python: 
The backend logic and encryption/decryption algorithms are implemented using Python.
### > Streamlit:
 The user interface is built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating web applications.
### > Cryptography Libraries: 
Various cryptography libraries such as PyCryptodome are utilized for encryption and decryption functionalities.
### > Git :
Version control
